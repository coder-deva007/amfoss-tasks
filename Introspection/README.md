# Introspection
# Why must we choose you?
  I'm very much interested in computer science. I tried to make a simple game using C++. So I think this will be the best club that would help me getting those valuable knowledge for coding. And I think this would also help my communication skills by minkling with different personalities.
# What is your plan for the next 6 months?
  Since the classes are going to be online for the next three months, I need to focus on the academics. It is also very difficult in watching the screens continuously for hours. So we need to give proper rest to the eyes and do the assignments, projects and tasks upto date.
# How would you contribute back to the club?
  I would contribute back to the club in any way as possible. I'm sure that this club would nurture my talent and brings responsibility which makes a good human being. So i would try my best to pass it's legacy.
# Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
  This is the best selection procedure that we can have. This allows the club to select those individuals who are very much interested to learn FOSS.
